# Tutorial and Inspiration for the project

I followed the [given tutoria](https://youtu.be/yKHJsLUENl0) to understand how to build the Todo application from scratch. However, I just referenced the base structure of the app and changed it according to the requirements of the assignment. I added my own stylistic choice along with the provided [css librar](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.4.2/dist/semantic.min.css) that already contains useful item fonts and sizings.
